# Problem 1

Create  a  function  that  will  take  in  a  vector x,  with  corresponding  probabilities p.x,assuming that these two vectors correspond to a discrete random variable.  Using the formulas for the mean and variance for a discrete random variable, have the function return the mean and variance of the following:


```{r}
#functions for finishing question 1:
find_mean = function(x, prob.x){
  return(sum(x * prob.x))
}

find_variance = function(x, probability.x){
  return(sum((x - find_mean(x, probability.x))^2 * probability.x))
}

```

a)

```{r}
#question
x = c(0,1,2,5,6,10)
p.x = c(0.50,0.05,0.10,0.05,0.05,0.25)

#answer
find_mean(x, p.x)
find_variance(x , p.x)
```


b)

```{r}
#question
x = seq(-20,0,2)
p.x = (1:11)/sum(1:11)

#answer
find_mean(x, p.x)
find_variance(x , p.x)
```


c)


```{r}
#question
x = 0:5
p.x = dbinom(0:5,5,0.50)

#answer
find_mean(x, p.x)
find_variance(x , p.x)
```
