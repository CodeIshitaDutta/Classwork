# Problem 2

a) Provide a brief list of R content you learned during lectures/discussion.
__Solution:__
  - How to make and use markdown file, arithmetic, variables
  - Saving and using data sets, percentiles
  - random sampling and using results
  - if/else statements
  - norm functions
  - histograms and boxplots
  - confidence intervals
  - summary() and lm()

b) What other items would you like to review/discuss in R?
__Solution:__ I would like to learn about reading csv files in R inside discussion, rather than using built in sets. This gives us a larger scope of data to work with.

c) What additional information in R did you learn on your own?
__Solution:__ I learned how to read csv files, as well as how to use the subset() function.
